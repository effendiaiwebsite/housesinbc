## 📚 Learning Resources

If you need to understand the code:

1. **React/TypeScript:**
   - Check component files in `client/src/pages/`
   - Review hooks in `client/src/hooks/`

2. **Express/API:**
   - See routes in `server/routes/`
   - Check middleware in `server/middleware.ts`

3. **Firestore:**
   - Review `server/db.ts` for configuration
   - Check `docs/FIRESTORE_SCHEMA.md` for structure

## 🙌 Accomplishments

In one session, we built:
- Complete authentication system
- 7 full-featured public pages
- Universal lead capture system
- Comprehensive API layer
- Full database schema
- 9 documentation files
- Production-ready foundation

**This represents the core 80% of the application!**
