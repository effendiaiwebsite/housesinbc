## Code Patterns to Follow

### Creating a New Page:
```tsx
import Navigation from '@/components/Navigation';
import Footer from '@/components/Footer';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col">
      <Navigation />

      <section className="py-16">
        {/* Your content */}
      </section>

      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Creating an API Route:
```typescript
// server/routes/myroute.ts
import { Router } from 'express';
import { collections } from '../db';
import { requireAdmin } from '../middleware';

const router = Router();

router.get('/my-endpoint', requireAdmin, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const data = await collections.myCollection.get();
    res.json({ data });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed' });
  }
});

export default router;
```

### Adding to Server:
```typescript
// server/index.ts
import myRoutes from './routes/myroute';
app.use('/api/myroute', myRoutes);
```

---

## Database Queries

### Add Document:
```typescript
const docRef = await collections.leads.add({
  name: 'John',
  createdAt: new Date(),
});
```

### Get Documents:
```typescript
const snapshot = await collections.leads
  .where('source', '==', 'mortgage')
  .orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
  .limit(10)
  .get();

const leads = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
  id: doc.id,
  ...doc.data()
}));
```

### Update Document:
```typescript
await collections.leads.doc(id).update({
  status: 'contacted',
  updatedAt: new Date(),
});
```

### Delete Document:
```typescript
await collections.leads.doc(id).delete();
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Module not found"
```bash
npm install
# Restart dev server
```

### Issue: Firestore permission denied
```javascript
// Check Firebase Console > Firestore > Rules
// Temporarily set to:
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;  // Development only!
    }
  }
}
```

### Issue: OTP not sending
- Check Twilio credentials in `.env`
- Look for OTP in terminal logs (development mode)
- Verify phone number format (+1234567890)
